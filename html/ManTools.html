    <h1>Manager Tools</h1>
   
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
    To help managers identify the best players to bring to their team, we created 4 
    tools that will help provide managers with deep insights into the players transfer market. 
    Here, managers can find the age and overall rating distribution of players within each league, 
    player ability based on player search, nationality distribution of players, and player passing ability vs wage.  


    </p>

    <h3>Find each of our manager tools below!!</h3>
    <ul>
       
    <button id = 'boxButton'> Age and Nationality Distributions</button>
    
        <script>
        const boxButton = document.getElementById("boxButton");
        boxButton.addEventListener('click', function(){
            window.location.href = 'bar.html';
        })
        </script>
    </ul>

        })

    <script>
        const navigateButton3 = document.getElementById("navigateButton3");
        navigateButton3.addEventListener('click', function(){
            window.location.href = 'passing_wage.html';
        })
    </script>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong> Findings & Conclusion</strong></h3>
    <p>
    Managers can use your tools to find the most suitable player to add to their club 
    by using our visualizations to identify where they should be looking for a player using 
    the nationality distribution, find out what age is the most ideal for a player overall rating, then find 
    the if the club will be able to afford that player's yearly salary and if the player has high passing 
    capabilities, and search for how much money is needed to sign a player onto a different team.
