      a player can cost soccer clubs millions of dollars throughout the process. Making each player research and signing 
      efficiency critical for managers to consider in the investment process. In this player search, we plan to show player

    <h3><strong> Findings & Conclusion</strong></h3>
    <p>The scatter plot can determine potential players that is needed for a specific club and minimum amount of money club 
        needed to sign the player. Each scatter plot representing each position have different distibution of players and 
        some players does overlap in the scatter plots showing that some players can play multiple positions. Overall, from our
        scatter plot we were able  to create a tool to help managers to find potential players with the aligning composition to match 
        the club's needs to improve. The plot also show that there is high amount of alternative for each position from the 3 leagues 
        we chose. By providing basic composition metrics of each player and monetary factos like wage and release clause 
        these visualization can be an effective tool to use for club managers.
