    <h1>League Analysis</h1>
   
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      There are many leagues in the data set and each league is different from 
      fans' energy to the players skill level. We believe that each league will 
      have different level competitiveness making some leagues more attractive than 
      others for both the audience and players. We determine the difference in 
      competitiveness by looking at the distribution of the player's overall rating. 
      In addition, by analyzing the distribution of players in each league, we will
       be able to find the quantitative results that tells us the benchmark of each 
       league and deeper understanding of top tier players.

    <h3><strong> Findings & Conclusion</strong></h3>
    <p>
      From the boxplot we found that each league has different player distribution, 
      thus, different minimum requirements to enter the league and different competitiveness. 
      We were able to identify similar leagues with similar player skill levels that
      managers can use to consider when starting to search for players to transfer.  
      More importantly, by analyzing the interquartile range and the distribution of 
      the players skill level, we were able to determine the exact quantitative result 
      to differentiate a top tier player for each league. Overall we were able to analyze 
      the difference in leagues and create a tool that can be use in early stages of player 
      transferring process for the clubs in the soccer world.
